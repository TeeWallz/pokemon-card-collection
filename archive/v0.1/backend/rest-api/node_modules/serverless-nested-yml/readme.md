# Serverless Nested Yml

This plugin help to tiddy your project by splitting your yaml file by sub directory.
It then merge all the globed files in to one configuration.

## Install

`npm install serverless-nested-yml --save-dev`

Next, add the serverless-nested-yml plugin in to serverless.yml file: If you don't already have a plugins section, create one that looks like this:

```

  - serverless-nested-yml
```

To verify that the plugin was added successfully, run this in your command line:

serverless
The plugin should show up in the "Plugins" section of the output as "ServerlessNestedYml"

## Usage
In your main serverless.yml file you should define the common properties used by all your functions.

    filename: // Filename to search | optional, string - default *serverless.yml
    paths:    // Path to search | optional, string | array - default ['src']
